**Wh-questions** are questions that begin with a wh-word (such as *why*, *how*, *when*, *what*, *who*, *where*, etc.). These questions are used to elicit specific information rather than a simple "yes" or "no" answer. Linguistically, they are also known as **open questions** because they allow for an open set of possible answers, as opposed to closed (yes–no) questions, which restrict responses to a finite set (usually "yes" or "no")[5].
 examples:
1. Why do S V O?
2. How many times did S V O?
3. When did S V O?
4. Since when have S V O?
